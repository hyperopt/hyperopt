class TheanoBanditAlgo(base.BanditAlgo):
    """
    Base class for a BanditAlgorithm using the idxs,vals format for storing
    configurations rather than the list-of-document format.

    The idxs, vals format plays better with Theano implementations of GP models
    and PBIL and stuff.

    Instances deriving from this remember more information about suggested
    points than they return via self.suggest().
    That information is stored in the attributes self.db_idxs and self.db_vals.
    When the suggest() method receives a list documents that should be used to
    condition the suggestion, this class retrieves each document's '_config_id'
    key, and uses that key to look up information in self.db_idxs and
    self.db_vals.

    Consequently to storing this extra info in self.db_idxs and self.db_vals, it
    is essential that instances of this class be pickled in order for them to
    resume properly. It is not enough to pass a list of documents to the suggest
    method, for the algorithm to resume optimization.

    :type s_idxs:
        list of symbolic integer vectors

    :param s_idxs:

        the i'th configuration variable is defined

    :type s_vals:
        list of symbolic ndarrays

    :param s_vals:
        the i'th ndarray contains the values for the i'th variables at the
        sample positions indicated in s_idxs.

    :type s_N:
        symbolic int

    :param s_N:
        the number of samples drawn from the prior

    :type db_idxs:
        list of integer lists

    :param db_idxs:
        positions where the corresponding element of s_idxs is
        defined.
