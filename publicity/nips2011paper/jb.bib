      pages = {249-256},
   abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficia
l. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

    title = {Scaling Learning Algorithms towards {AI}},
    booktitle = {Large Scale Kernel Machines},
    year = {2007},
    publisher = {MIT Press},
    abstract = {One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that
    are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), reasoning,
    intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue
    that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must
    endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal
    need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present
    mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches
    to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited
    in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis
    focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in
    which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer

    of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient
    in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second,
    we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the
    curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning)
    and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant
    image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in
    which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract
    and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the
    potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and
    that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required
    for artificial intelligence.},

     abstract = {The affine-sigmoidal hidden unit (of the form $\sigma(ax+b)$)
    is a crude predictor of neuron response in visual area V1.
    More descriptive models of V1 have been advanced that are no more computationally expensive,
    yet artificial neural network research continues to focus on networks of affine-sigmoidal models.
    This paper identifies two qualitative differences between the affine-sigmoidal hidden unit
    and a particular recent model of V1 response:
    a) the presence of a low-rank quadratic term in the argument to $\sigma$,
    and b) the use of a gentler non-linearity than the $\tanh$ or logistic sigmoid.
    We evaluate these model ingredients by training single-layer
    neural networks to solve three image classification tasks.
    We experimented with fully-connected hidden units,
    as well as locally-connected units and convolutional units
    that more closely mimic the function and connectivity of the visual system.
    On all three tasks, both the quadratic interactions and the gentler non-linearity
    lead to significantly better generalization.
    The advantage of quadratic units was strongest in conjunction with sparse and convolutional hidden units.}

In this sense, multilayer feedforward networks are a class of universal approximators.},

Though they have demonstrated impressive performance, to date, they have only been evaluated on relatively simple problems such as digit  recognition in a controlled environment, for which many machine learning algorithms already report reasonable results. Here, we present a series of experiments which indicate that these models show promise in solving harder learning problems that exhibit many factors of variation. These models are compared with well-established algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks.},

Quadratic filters, a simplification of theoretical model of V1 complex cells, reliably increase accuracy. In fact, logistic regression with quadratic filters outperforms a standard single hidden layer neural network. Adding quadratic filters to logistic regression is almost as effective as feature engineering. Despite predicting each output label independently, our model is competitive with ones that use previous decisions.}
