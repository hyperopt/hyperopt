1. Update the version number in hyperopt/__init__.py
2. Remove old wheels: sudo rm -rf dist/*
3. Build wheels for current version: sudo python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
4. git tag <version> -m "message to identify, if needed"
5. git push origin <version>
6. Upload to PyPI with twine: twine upload dist/*
7. announce to hyperopt-announce (maybe also scikit-learn?)
